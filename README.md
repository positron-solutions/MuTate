### Open Product, Directly Sponsored by Positron

µTate is being developed by Positron to demonstrate the features of
[PrizeForge](https://prizeforge.com).  The [stream for
mutate](https://prizeforge.com/streams/details/163AQ5rQj92) is continuously
raising funds.  Want to write code?  The PrizeForge stream exists to reward
people like you.  Anyone can contribute funds, code or ideas.  In any case,
Positron is committed to standing the project up.

### What Can Done Better With A New Visualizer?

- Anticipate beats from patterns of beats and experience
- Distinguish different melodies and recognize layered patterns
- Recognize lyrics and musical features to use as input.
- Generate content such as textures and color palettes for munging together traditional
  procedural techniques
- Accept text prompts to create lightweight customizations
- Steel scheme scripting language for preset programming

Got a better idea?  We would love to hear it.
