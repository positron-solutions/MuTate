    µTate (MuTate) is a project to build a modern music visualization program
    and library, using Vulkan and local AI models in Rust.

## Stub! 🚧

This repo was started to make links work.  Here's a tip about music visualizer programming:

Project M etc all use a pretty fun trick.  You just re-use last frame's output
buffers as input buffers for the new frame.  With a blending factor, this
creates a ghosting affect.  If you have seen any of my YouTube videos feature
Jean Claude Van Damme, the same effect was used in a shader.  Tricks like this
are the basis of continuously warping the output.

### What Can Done Better With A New Visualizer?

- Anticipate beats from patterns of beats and experience
- Distinguish different melodies and recognize layered patterns
- Recognize lyrics and musical features to use as input.
- Generate content such as textures and color palettes for munging together traditional
  procedural techniques
- Accept text prompts to create lightweight customizations
- Steel scheme scripting language for preset programming

### Open Product, Directly Sponsored by Positron

µTate is being developed by Positron to demonstrate the features of
[PrizeForge](https://prizeforge.com).  The [stream for
mutate](https://prizeforge.com/streams/details/163AQ5rQj92) is continuously
raising funds to attract new code contributions.  Anyone can contribute funds or
code, but Positron is committed to standing the project up.
